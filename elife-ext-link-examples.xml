from Hin (PDB ID: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1ijw">1IJW</ext-link>); the lengths of helix-1 in resolvases vary. Solvent-exposed residues Gln151, Arg154, and Leu155, which are proposed to directly or indirectly interact with Fis, are uniquely conserved among DNA invertases. Sin residues Val163 and Ile164 (underlined) mediate synapsis of regulatory subunits during formation of the Sin synaptic complex
