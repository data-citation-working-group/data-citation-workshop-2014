Fis-activated DNA inversion (<xref ref-type="table" specific-use="data" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) shown as spheres (C&#x3b2; atoms). Asterisks signify residues exhibiting BMOE crosslinking with Fis-Q21C when replaced with cysteine; 

 in the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" specific-use="data" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Two of the four lysines in the DBD are located in the unstructured C-terminal segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2002</xref>), which is not present in other DNA invertases and can be deleted from Hin without affecting Fis-activated DNA inversion. The remaining eight lysines were each individually mutated to alanine and tested
